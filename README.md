# Midterm3
CIS214 Midterm v3

This is the third version of my CIS214 C# Midterm.

This program creates a new Invoice object, setting the Part Number, Part Description, Part Quantity, 
and the Part's Price, from the user input requested in the InvoiceTest class.

Class Invoice utilizes automatic properties.

When the loop exits in InvoiceTest, each invoice is printed to the screen. This version is the same as v2 
except it does not count the number of invoices nor does it sum all invoice totals.
